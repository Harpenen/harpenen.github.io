    <h1>Harpss test page</h1> <!-- Headers use the <h1> element and is used to mark a page header. This element is used to define chapters so don't use it just to change text appearance. -->

    <h2>Formatting and links</h2> <!-- Subheaders use the <h2> element and is used to mark a page subheader. This element is also used to define chapters so don't use it just to change text appearance. -->

    <p>This line is a test of <strong>strong text</strong> and <a href="https://github.com/HarpssB/harpssb.github.io" title="The Github repo for this website" target="_blank">absolute links</a> within a paragraph.</p> <!-- Absolute links point to a specific file through its location on the web. The protocal and domain name are required. -->

    <p>This is a test of relative links: <a href="images/spon.gif" title="An image used on this site" target="_blank">images/spon.gif</a> </p> <!-- Relative links point to a location relative to the file you are linking from. The protocol and domain name should not be included. -->

    <h2>Code within the visible document</h2>

    <p>This line is a test of including special HTML characters: &lt; &gt; &quot; &amp; &apos;</p>

    <p>&lt;p&gt;A line of text looks like this in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;!-- Comments look like this in HTML --&gt;</p>

    <!-- This actually sucks and it'd suck even more if Visual Studio didn't add the end markers for me. Hello if you're looking through the code in Inspect Element or Github though! -->

    <p>/* Comments look like this in css and javascript */</p>

    <p>//Although in javascript you can do comments like this without a special close marker</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    
    <h3>Unordered lists</h3> <!-- Sub-Subheaders use the <h3> element and is used to mark a page Sub-Subheader. This element is also used to define chapters so don't use it just to change text appearance. -->

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strong</strong></li>
      <li><em>Emphasis</em></li>
      <li><em><strong>Strong + Emphasis</strong></em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ordered lists</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>The numbers on the left is an effect of ordered lists.</li>
      <li>Unordered lists replace the numbers with dots.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You can put lists inside of eachother</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The image below changes when you click on it.</li>

    <!-- There is no examples of this on this website, but to reach a file in a directory above the html document, you would use 2 dots in the file path like this: "../../../../Windows/Media/Alarm01.wav" -->
    <!-- In this example, the html document is located in a folder on my desktop, so I go back 4 times through my desktop, user folder, users folder, until I reach the root directory of my C: drive. -->
    <!-- From there, I go down into windows' media folder, and select an audio file -->
    <!-- Since this website is hosted on github and not my desktop, going up through directorys in this document would lead nowhere -->
