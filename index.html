    <h1>Harpss' test page</h1>

    <p>This line is a test of <strong>bold text</strong> and <a href="https://github.com/HarpssB/harpssb.github.io" title="The Github repo for this website" target="_blank">links</a> within a paragraph.</p>

    <p>This line is a test of including special HTML characters: &lt; &gt; &quot; &amp; &apos;</p>

    <p>&lt;p&gt;A line of text looks like this in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
   
    <p>The following is a test of unordered lists and text formatting.</p>

    <p>&lt;!-- Comments look like this in HTML and suck compared to css' and javascript's superior /* */ comment system --&gt;</p>

    <!-- This actually sucks and it'd suck even more if Visual Studio didn't add the end markers for me. Hello if you're looking through the code in Inspect Element or Github though! -->

    <p>/* Comments look like this in css and javascript */</p>

    <p>//Although in javascript you have the option of doing comments like this without a special close marker</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bold</strong></li>
      <li><em>Italic</em></li>
      <li><em><strong>Bold Italic</strong></em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following is a test of ordered lists.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The numbers on the left is an effect of ordered lists.</li>
      <li>Unordered lists replace the numbers with dots.</li>
      <li>The image below changes when you click on it.</li>
    </ol>
